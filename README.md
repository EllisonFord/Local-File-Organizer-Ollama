## Updates 🚀

**[2024/09] v0.0.2**:
* Featured by [Nexa Gallery](https://nexaai.com/gallery) and [Nexa SDK Cookbook](https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk/tree/main/examples)!
* Dry Run Mode: check sorting results before committing changes
* Silent Mode: save all logs to a txt file for quieter operation
* Added file support:  `.md`, .`excel`, `.ppt`, and `.csv` 
* Three sorting options: by content, by date, and by type
* The default text model is now [Llama3.2 3B](https://nexaai.com/meta/Llama3.2-3B-Instruct/gguf-q3_K_M/file)
* Improved CLI interaction experience
* Added real-time progress bar for file analysis

Please update the project by deleting the original project folder and reinstalling the requirements. Refer to the installation guide from Step 4.


## Roadmap 📅

- [ ] Copilot Mode: chat with AI to tell AI how you want to sort the file (ie. read and rename all the PDFs)
- [ ] Change models with CLI 
- [ ] ebook format support
- [ ] audio file support
- [ ] video file support
- [ ] Implement best practices like Johnny Decimal
- [ ] Check file duplication
- [ ] Dockerfile for easier installation
- [ ] People from [Nexa](https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk) is helping me to make executables for macOS, Linux and Windows

## What It Does 🔍

This intelligent file organizer harnesses the power of advanced AI models, including language models (LMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), to automate the process of organizing files by:


* Scanning a specified input directory for files.
* Content Understanding: 
  - **Textual Analysis**: Uses the [Llama3.2 3B](https://nexaai.com/meta/Llama3.2-3B-Instruct/gguf-q3_K_M/file) to analyze and summarize text-based content, generating relevant descriptions and filenames.
  - **Visual Content Analysis**: Uses the [LLaVA-v1.6](https://nexaai.com/liuhaotian/llava-v1.6-vicuna-7b/gguf-q4_0/file) , based on Vicuna-7B, to interpret visual files such as images, providing context-aware categorization and descriptions.

* Understanding the content of your files (text, images, and more) to generate relevant descriptions, folder names, and filenames.
* Organizing the files into a new directory structure based on the generated metadata.

The best part? All AI processing happens 100% on your local device using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) running locally. No internet connection required, no data leaves your computer, and no external AI API keys are needed — keeping your files completely private and secure.


## Supported File Types 📁

- **Images:** `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.bmp`
- **Text Files:** `.txt`, `.docx`, `.md`
- **Spreadsheets:** `.xlsx`, `.csv`
- **Presentations:** `.ppt`, `.pptx`

## Prerequisites 💻

- **Operating System:** Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Python Version:** Python 3.12
- **Conda:** Anaconda or Miniconda installed.
- **Git:** For cloning the repository (or you can download the code as a ZIP file).

## Installation 🛠

> For SDK installation and model-related issues, please post on [here](https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk/issues).

### 1. Install Python

Before installing the Local File Organizer, make sure you have Python installed on your system. We recommend using Python 3.12 or later.

You can download Python from [the official website]((https://www.python.org/downloads/)).

Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/QiuYannnn/Local-File-Organizer.git
```

Or download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.

### 3. Set Up the Python Environment

Create a new Conda environment named `local_file_organizer` with Python 3.12:

```zsh
conda create --name local_file_organizer python=3.12
```

Activate the environment:

```zsh
conda activate local_file_organizer
```

### 4. Install and Run Ollama ️

This project now uses Ollama to run models locally via HTTP.

- Install Ollama: https://ollama.com/download
  - macOS: `brew install --cask ollama`
  - Linux: `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh`
  - Windows: Download and install from the website.
- Start the Ollama service (if it doesn't start automatically):
  ```bash
  ollama serve
  ```
- Pull the required models:
  ```bash
  ollama pull llama3.2:3b
  ollama pull llava:7b
  ```


### 5. Install Dependencies 

1. Ensure you are in the project directory:
   ```zsh
   cd path/to/Local-File-Organizer
   ```
   Replace `path/to/Local-File-Organizer` with the actual path where you cloned or extracted the project.

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```zsh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Note:** If you encounter issues with any packages, install them individually:

```zsh
pip install Pillow pytesseract PyMuPDF python-docx
```

With the environment activated and dependencies installed, run the script using:

### 6. Running the Script🎉
```zsh
python main.py
```

## Notes

- **Ollama Models:**
  - The script uses `llava:7b` (vision) and `llama3.2:3b` (text) via the local Ollama service at http://localhost:11434.
  - Ensure Ollama is running and these models are pulled (`ollama pull llava:7b` and `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`).
  - No external API keys are required; everything runs locally.


- **Dependencies:**
  - **pytesseract:** Requires Tesseract OCR installed on your system.
    - **macOS:** `brew install tesseract`
    - **Ubuntu/Linux:** `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`
    - **Windows:** Download from [Tesseract OCR Windows Installer](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
  - **PyMuPDF (fitz):** Used for reading PDFs.

- **Processing Time:**
  - Processing may take time depending on the number and size of files.
  - The script uses multiprocessing to improve performance.

- **Customizing Prompts:**
  - You can adjust prompts in `data_processing.py` to change how metadata is generated.
